EXERCISE 1 

The goal of this project is to retrieve data from the accelerometer by using I²C.
We need to send these data on a terminal using UART in DMA mode every 1 sec within a timer interrupt.

First we need to do the configuration of the I²C : 
For the pins, we have : 
- PB8 = I2C1_SCL
- PB9 = I2C1_SDA
We also need to change the mode of the I²C from "Disable" to "I²C".

Moreover, we want to send the data recovers to a terminal.
The configuration of USART is by default, we have the principal parameters : 
	- Mode : Asynchronous
	- RS232 : Disable
	- Baud Rate : 115200 Bits/s
We want the USART to works in DMA mode, so we activate the interrupts in the NVIC tab.
We also configure the DMA request fort USART2_TX in normal mode and with the Data Width in Byte.

We also need to recover and send the data at a rate of 1Hz (1 sec)
So we need to configure the timer TIM3, we have these principal parameters : 
	- Clock Source : Internal Clock
	- Prescaler : 8399
	- Period : 9999
	- Trigger Event Selection : Update Event
We also need to activate the interruption on the NVIC Tab

Like that, the timer doesn't work because the priority of the interruption need to be different than the I²C and the USART
So, in the NVIC tab, we change the the preemption priority of the timer interrupt from "0" to "1"

We can activate the floats in the properties tab of the projects.

After the configuration done, we can now code the program :
