HOMEWORK 1
	General questions

HOMEWORK 2
	Speak on a microphone and light up a LED
	PWM of 1Hz to blink a LED

HOMEWORK 3
	Play a song using the speaker when the microphone detects a loud sound (INTERRUPT)

HOMEWORK 4
	Send information from the microcontroller to the PC, using the USART (DMA)
	Write on the LCD the name of each member of your group, one per line, in alphabetical order. (NO INTERRUPT)
	
HOMEWORK 5
	Acquire the potentiometer voltage using a timer to trigger a conversion at a regular conversion rate of 1 Hz and sending the value to a remote terminal by using UART (TIMER INTERRUPT, NO UART INTERRUPT, ADC)
	Acquire the potentiometer voltage using a timer to trigger a conversion at a regular conversion rate of 1 Hz and showing the value on the LCD (TIMER INTERRUPT, ADC)
	Try sending from the PC via UART a string of variable length that is displayed on the LCD (NO INTERRUPT)

HOMEWORK 6
	Acquire 3 voltages (potentiometer, temperature sensor, Vref) every 1s and to send them to a remote terminal. (TIMER TRIGGERING, ADC DMA, UART DMA)
	Acquire LDR resistance value every ms and to send its average value to a remote terminal every 1s. Convert the resistance value to a lux level and send that to the remote terminal. (TIMER TRIGGERING, ADC DMA, UART DMA)

HOMEWORK 7
	Read the temperature measured by the LM75 and send it to a remote terminal every 1 second within an interrupt routine. We will read the 11 bits so the LSB and the MSB. (TIMER INTERRUPT, UART DMA, I²C DMA)

HOMEWORK 8
	Sequentially read the x, y, and z accelerometer data every second and transmit these values to the computer via UART. (TIMER INTERRUPT, UART DMA, I²C DMA)

HOMEWORK 9
	Transmit a letter to the LED matrix using SPI and a timer interrupt & Alternate between two letters (TIMER INTERRUPT, SPI DMA)

HOMEWORK 10
	Scan each column and read the keyboard using a timer interrupt (USART DMA, TIMER INTERRUPT)
	Read the encoder position and send to the PC the rotation speed in rpm (USART DMA, TIMER INTERRUPT)
