EXERCISE 1

So we first take the same file from the song exercise, and we are going to reuse the same song
We config PA9 (the speaker) to work as a PWM (TIM1 on Channel 2)
We then config PA8(microphone) to work as an interrupt (GPIO_EXTI)
We go to NVIC Tab and we enable "EXTI line[9:5] interrupts"
After that we go to the GPIO tab and we change the GPIO mode of PA8 to "External Interrupt Mode with Rising edge trigger detection"
And can go to the stm32f4xx_it.c file and found the function "EXTI9_5_IRQHandler"
For the code, we reuse the function to Play a song from the exercice b
We add the function of callback and when the interruption is on the PIN of the microphone (PA8), a global variable goes to 1
This variable is used in a infinite loop where we check if its value is one, and then we can play the music
After the music is finished, we can change the value of this variable to 0.

Here is the code of the callback : 
void HAL_GPIO_EXTI_Callback(uint16_t GPIO_Pin)
{
	switch(GPIO_Pin)
	{
		case GPIO_PIN_8:
			currently_playing = 1;
			break;

		default:
			break;
	}
}

And here is the code of the infinite loop :
while (1)
  {
    /* USER CODE END WHILE */
	if (currently_playing) 			/** If it isn't playing **/
	{
		PlayMusic();			/** Start the music **/
		currently_playing = 0; 		/** Unblock the condition **/
	}
    /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
  }

EXERCISE 2
We are going to ue a Timer instead of a HAL_Delay. So we want a timer of 1Hz
We configure the Timer TIM3 like a PWM generator on Channel1
We want 1Hz so we need to follow the next formula : 
Fpwm = Fclk / ((1+period) * (1+prescaler))
	- Fpwm = frequency of the PWM signal (1Hz)
	- Fclk = Clock Frequency (84 MHz)
	- period = Counter of the timer
	- prescaler = Prescaler of the timer
((1+period) * (1+prescaler)) needs to be at 1Hz
the period and the prescaler needs to be under their maximum value so 65535
So we take a prescaler of 8399 and a period of 9999
Moreover, we need to take a duty cycle of 50% so half of the period
That's why we need to config the pulse at 4999
