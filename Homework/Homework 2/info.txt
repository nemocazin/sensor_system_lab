We configure the Timer TIM1 like a PWM generator on Channel1
We want 1Hz so we need to follow the next formula : 
Fpwm = Fclk / ((1+period) * (1+prescaler))
	- Fpwm = frequency of the PWM signal (1Hz)
	- Fclk = Clock Frequency (84 MHz)
	- period = Counter of the timer
	- prescaler = Prescaler of the timer
((1+period) * (1+prescaler)) needs to be at 1Hz
the period and the prescaler needs to be under their maximum value so 65535
So we take a period of 8399 and a period of 9999
