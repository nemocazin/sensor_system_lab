We configure the Timer TIM1 like a PWM generator on Channel1
We want 1Hz so we need to follow the next formula : 
Fpwm = Fclk / ((1+period) * (1+prescaler))
	- Fpwm = frequency of the PWM signal (1Hz)
	- Fclk = Clock Frequency (84 MHz)
	- period = Counter of the timer
	- prescaler = Prescaler of the timer
((1+period) * (1+prescaler)) needs to be at 1Hz
the period and the prescaler needs to be under their maximum value so 65535
So we take a period of 8399 and a period of 9999
Moreover, we need to take a duty cycle of 50% so half of the period
That's why we need to config the pulse at 4999
The PWM is configured so now we need to make the function to know when the LED need to change her state
For that, we use the condition : "__HAL_TIM_GET_COMPARE(&htim1, TIM_CHANNEL_1) > __HAL_TIM_GET_COUNTER(&htim1)"
It checks whether the current counter value is less than the comparison value.
However, we have tried several types of variable to change the state of the LED (uint8_t and int).
In the case of int, the LED only lights up partially or not at all. We therefore chose the uint8_t type.
